Clariontrust is a Scam - Honest Review based on personal experience

Clariontrust is a scam, plain and simple based on personal experience

They bait you in with a few weeks of profits and promises and rainbows... and then destiny!!!

Hello, I am writing this quick and brief article to warn people of the investment site Clariontrust (aka Clarion Trust) as well as the person, Charlotta Louise on Facebook who introduced it to me and then subsequently bullied me into taking down true and honest review.

And to be clear, this is not clickbait as I am not promoting anything else or trying to gain notoriety, it is purely to protect others from making the same mistake that I did and not lose money.

In November 2020, Charlotta Louise convinced me to try Clariontrust (Clarion Trust) for high returns (see attached image of levels of returns promised) on my money, promising levels of 1.5% per day as well as being able to take out the original investment (with a 10% fee), so I started at the minimum level of $1,000. All was great and as promised, so good returns…. For only 4 weeks!!! Each week I saw wonderful returns of 1.5% for 6 days of the week and was able to withdrawal those profits, so all was going good, for a month. As well, during this time, Charlotta Louise continued to push me to upgrade to the $10,000 or more level based on success I as having and would make so much more if increased my deposit amount as well as many other promises of compounding and bitcoin education and other ways to make money.

She even had me on WhatsApp group chat where there others who were apparently succeeding and making tons of money. Charlotta Louise even then chatted me up and started talking about a relationship and sex and moving, etc… Regrettably even asking me  to  and then getting me to send her a dick pick (which I have never done before or even been asked to do, now I know why. Obviously, there was a purpose). Unfortunately, Being a single and lonely guy, I gave into her sexual draw and did her request.

Long story short:

* After 4 weeks of successful withdrawals, the approvals all stopped (see attached image) and no more withdrawals were approved. 
* My live chat seems to have been disabled. 
* No reply from “Support” on many tickets asking why withdrawals were rejected. 
* Continue to generate weekly profits but still unable to withdrawal profits or original investment. 
* I ask the WhatsApp chat if they know anything about why this is happening. They then continue to just say be patient and maybe if I upgrade to $10,000 I wouldn’t have this problem. Obviously, they are all in on it. And as I continued to discuss my negative experience and ask if anyone can help other than saying out more money in, they kick me out of the group. 
* I submit negative reviews on Trust Pilot .com and inform Charlotta Louise who then subsequently threatens me that she will post the regrettable images she asked for and I sent her, in good faith and trust. 
* As of today, January 02, 2020 they have apparently deleted all of my history and al of my profits so I am not even able to continue to attempt to make withdrawal requests, even though they were all being rejected. So, I guess they didn’t like the real truthful negative reviews and have shut me right down. 
Lesson learned.

Summary
Clariontrust dot com aka Clarion Trust is a pure and simple scam that has many players involved and have a pretty smart communication strategy to bait you into increasing your investment. My result, a loss of $600 USD.

Here is my review that I sent into Trustpilot.com:
“Will bait you in and then scam you
12/23/20: Made a minimum deposit in November and proceeded with a couple withdrawals with no problems after a couple weeks. They continued to push me to upgrade to a higher amount, enticing me with more opportunities once I do. But them the withdrawals stopped by being rejected with only "we are going through an upgrade" as an explanation. Support is horrible giving the same, "please be patient" and "your withdrawal will be approved shortly" then it never is. Have cancelled my original contract but not able to withdrawal current profit balance as well as initial deposit. Will keep you updated.

January 02, 2020:
Still trying to withdrawal funds but to no avail. On top of that, I am now being threatened by the lady who introduced it to me to post character damaging material about me. So they take this to a whole new level. Even more reason to avoid Clarion Trust.

And now, having gone to my account, all history is gone, there is no profits, no ability to even try and attempt to withdrawal. So, I guess they didn't like the truthful negative reviews and have shut me down.

Lesson learned.

What's funny, is all it does it motivate me to post more negative blogs posts, articles and to news feeds about Clarion Trust.”

Also, stay away from Remaxinvestment.net. Here is my negative review on Trustpilot.com I sent for Remaxinvestment:

“Will bait you in with small withdrawal and then stop paying you with no support or reasooning.
12/01/20: Made a $200 deposit and proceeded with the withdrawal with no problems after a week. Then increased it for one more week and again no problem withdrawing. The issue occurred when I finally put in a few thousand and boom, not able to withdrawal anything. Withdrawal request are placed in pending and then cancelled after about 6 hours in pending. Support is horrible giving the same, "please be patient" and "your withdrawal will be approved shortly" then it never is. Have been trying to get my money out for 2 weeks to no prevail. Was sucked in by adelinefredrick45 on Instagram (Adeline Frederick).

Update 12/23/20: Still trying to get my money out. Support goes silence when I address it. They are there to say "How can they help" but the moment I ask, silence and no reply.”
